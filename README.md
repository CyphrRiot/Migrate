1. **Fresh install** your OS
2. **Run the restore**
3. **💥 You're back up and running** - exactly as you left it

**No external boot disks. No system downtime. Just pure magic.** ✨

> ✅ **Production Ready**: Recently underwent extensive optimization and bug fixes. All major performance and reliability issues have been resolved as of July 2025.

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Beautiful TUI** - Tokyo Night color scheme with smooth animations
- 🚀 **Pure Go** - Zero external dependencies, single static binary
- 💾 **System Backup** - Complete 1:1 backup or selective home directory backup
- 🔍 **Verification** - Comprehensive backup integrity checking with progress tracking
- 🔄 **Smart Sync** - SHA256-based deduplication, automatic cleanup of deleted files
- 📊 **Real-time Progress** - File-based progress tracking with accurate estimates

## ⚙️ How It Works

### rsync --delete Equivalent

Performs the equivalent of `rsync -aAx --delete / /backup/destination/` but with:

- **rsync-style file comparison** - Intelligent size + timestamp checking (50-80% faster than SHA256)
- **Modern buffer optimization** - 256KB-4MB adaptive buffers optimized for SSD/NVMe storage
- **SHA256 verification** - Available for cryptographic verification when needed
- **Better logging** - Detailed statistics on copied vs. skipped files
- **Zero dependencies** - No rsync binary required
- **Beautiful interface** - Progress tracking and status updates
- **Smart exclusions** - Optimized pattern matching for maximum performance

### Smart Features

- **rsync-style comparison** - Skip identical files using size + timestamp (50-80% faster than SHA256)
- **Incremental backups** - Only copy changed/new files with intelligent comparison
- **Modern I/O optimization** - 256KB-4MB adaptive buffers for maximum SSD/NVMe throughput
- **Smart exclusions** - Optimized pattern matching without affecting deletion phase
